# Quiet Development Mode

This project now supports multiple development modes with different levels of logging:

## Available Scripts

### 1. Standard Development
```bash
npm run dev
```
- Shows all Next.js compilation logs
- Shows all HTTP request logs
- Full debugging information

### 2. Quiet Development
```bash
npm run dev:quiet
```
- Reduces Next.js compilation logs
- Still shows some request information
- Good balance between debugging and clean output

### 3. Minimal Development (Recommended)
```bash
npm run dev:minimal
```
- Shows only essential startup information
- Hides compilation logs
- Hides most HTTP request logs
- Clean, minimal terminal output
- Only shows errors and important messages

## What Was Cleaned Up

✅ Removed all `console.log` statements from:
- Dashboard stats API route
- Dashboard page component
- Mill outputs API route

✅ Updated Next.js configuration to:
- Reduce logging output
- Disable detailed compilation logs
- Optimize development experience

## Usage

For the cleanest development experience, use:
```bash
npm run dev:minimal
```

This will show only:
- Server startup message
- Local and Network URLs
- Error messages (if any)
- Essential status updates

All the unwanted compilation and request logs are now hidden!
